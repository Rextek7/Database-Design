# Database-Design
Conceptual, logical, physical database model

# Description
### The recruitment department needs to structure their data and analyse their work.
### There are 10 people working in this department and everyone keeps their own personal file with candidates. This is inconvenient, so we need to create a single database.
### The task of department employees is to find the right candidates for open vacancies.
### Vacancies are also posted on hh.ru. 
### Each candidate passes several stages of selection.
### At the final stage he passes the TalentQ test and is checked by the Security Service.


# Conceptual model
### The conceptual model represents the developments and possible actions of the user
